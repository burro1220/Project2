# Project-2
//

***
This is a basic readme to meet project requirements for Treehouse Project-2
a project on DOM manipulation.

This project required the creation of functions to create, show and hide HTML elements based on conditions.

I am going for "Exceeds Requirements"

This project was created by Blake Burroughs.
